# Neuro Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Echo State Networks for CartPole
This repository implements a hybrid neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning agent for the "CartPole-v1" environment using PyTorch. The model combines symbolic reasoning, based on interpretable rules for features like pole angle and cart position, with a reservoir-based Echo State Network (ESN) for state-space dynamics.
